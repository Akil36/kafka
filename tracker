🛣️ KAFKA ROADMAP – BEGINNER TO ADVANCED
🟢 1. Beginner Level – Kafka Basics						done

✅ Goal: Understand what Kafka is, how it works, and basic hands-on with Producer/Consumer.

🔹 Topics to Learn:
		What is Kafka?

		Why Kafka (vs RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, etc.)

		Core Concepts:

		Broker

		Topic

		Partition

		Producer

		Consumer

		Consumer Groups

		Offset

		Kafka Use Cases (real-time analytics, event streaming, etc.)

🔹 Hands-on:
		Install Kafka locally (Windows/Linux)

		Create a topic

		Start producer/consumer from CLI

		Use Kafka with Spring Boot: Simple Producer/Consumer (we already did ✅)

📘 Resource: Apache Kafka Official Docs

🟡 2. Intermediate Level – Development with Kafka
✅ Goal: Build robust apps using Kafka in real projects.

🔹 Topics to Learn:
		Kafka with Spring Boot (Advanced):

		Configuring producers and consumers			            done

		Error handling, retries, dead-letter topics

		KafkaTemplate, KafkaListener, etc.			            done

		Sending/Receiving JSON data					                done

		Custom Serializers/Deserializers			              done

		Kafka Headers								                        done

		Partitioning logic & keys					                  done

		Offset management (manual vs auto)

		Kafka Streams basics

🔹 Hands-on:
		Spring Boot Kafka app with:

		Multiple consumers+

		Multiple topics

		JSON payloads and DTOs

		Error + Retry + DLQ handling

📘 Resource: Spring Kafka docs – https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/reference/html/

🔴 3. Advanced Level – Performance, Ops, Streams
✅ Goal: Become a Kafka pro who can scale, monitor, and build real-time pipelines.

🔹 Topics to Learn:
		Kafka Architecture in detail

		Internals:

		Log Segments

		ISR (In-Sync Replicas)

		Zookeeper role (or KRaft mode in newer versions)

		Kafka Streams (real-time processing)

		Kafka Connect (integration with DB, S3, etc.)

		Schema Registry (Avro/Protobuf)

		Kafka Security:

		SSL/SASL Authentication

		ACLs (Access control)

		Performance tuning

		Kafka monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

🔹 Hands-on:
		Kafka + Kafka Streams (join/filter/windowing)

		Kafka Connect with MySQL/Postgres

		Monitor Kafka metrics

		Setup secured Kafka cluster

📘 Tools:

Confluent Platform

Kafdrop UI

Burrow / Prometheus + Grafana

📅 Suggested Learning Timeline
			Week	Goal
			1	Learn core concepts + run CLI producer/consumer
			2	Spring Boot Kafka app (text & JSON)
			3-4	Error handling, DLQ, multiple topics/groups
			5-6	Kafka Streams & Connect
			7+	Security, tuning, monitoring, production use cases

🧰 Tools to Learn Along with Kafka
✅ Kafka CLI

✅ Spring Boot

✅ Confluent Schema Registry

✅ Kafka Connect

✅ Prometheus & Grafana

✅ Kafdrop (Kafka UI)

🔥 Bonus Practice Ideas
🛠 Build a real-time log processing app

📦 Create order-service and invoice-service using Kafka events

🎧 Build a notification system using Kafka topics per channel

📉 Stream data from Kafka → PostgreSQL using Kafka Connect
